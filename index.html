      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey y'all!  Thanks for coming to see my first little bit of internet.  This is my first live webpage (hosted by GitHub).  It is a project that I am working on for my Coding Bootcamp through UNC.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've lived in several places during my formative years, but the for the past (almost) two decades, Durham, NC has been home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video games and reading used to be the biggest contenders.  These days (pre pandemic) I spend most of my free time involved with a living history group called the SCA.  There I play as a medieval monk, practicing calligraphy and illumination.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Plan A is to be a professor of Linguistics.  But I'm also learning coding right now as a plan B.  We'll see where that takes me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>See above.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The pandemic has shown that computer related jobs will always be in demand (assuming a gigantic EM pulse doesn't wipe out all of modern technological infrastructure).</p>
